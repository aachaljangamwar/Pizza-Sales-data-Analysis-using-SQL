# Pizza-Sales-data-Analysis-using-SQL
In this project, I worked with four key tables: orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types, 
using SQL to:
* Identify the most popular pizza types and sizes.
* Analyze sales trends by day and time.
* Provide insights on average sales per order

Project Highlights:
ðŸ“ˆ Improved understanding of customer preferences.
ðŸ•’ Analysis of peak sales times for better staffing and inventory planning.
ðŸ’¡ Data-driven insights to optimize marketing strategies.

This project helped me enhance my SQL querying skills while providing actionable insights that could drive business performance in the food industry.
